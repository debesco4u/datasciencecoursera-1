## Issues in current model

- sometimes too specific for long sentences if a case is found in fivegrams (could be a case with only few observations)
- just taking the first most frequent word in the ngram
- heavy weight of ngrams (especially if fivegram is used). Shinyapps has upload limits?


## Improvements

- Remove fivegrams would make:
  - less objects to upload to shinyapps.io
  - searching process quicker
  - higher ngram models might generate overfitting (predictions too tied to sample text available)
  - offer more than one word to choose from
  - calculate probability of each next word instead of simply taking the most frequent one
  - measure accuracy over test dataset (I didn't split between training/test)
